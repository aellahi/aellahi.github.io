Hello and welcome to my personal page! My name is Aisha and I am a biologist & software engineer who specializes in building software and data science products for life sciences companies. I have worked on the data science and engineering teams of over four mid-stage startups in biotech, most recently [Enveda Biosciences](https://www.envedabio.com/).

I am a biologist at heart and a passionate believer in the power of data and technology. I also love communicating and teaching; check out the blog post I wrote when I was at Zymergen about the modeling we used to measure noise in our high-throughput screening process.
