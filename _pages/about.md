Hello and welcome to my personal page! My name is Aisha and I am a biologist & software engineer who specializes in building data science products for life sciences companies. I have worked on the data science and engineering teams of four mid-stage startups in biotech, most recently [Enveda Biosciences](https://www.envedabio.com/).

I am a biologist at heart and a passionate believer in the power of data, software, and AI to completely transform the way we engineer biology. I also love teaching others about this exciting topic! Check out the [blog post](/blog/beyond_the_t_test.html) I wrote about the Bayesian models we used at Zymergen to model plate effects in our high-throughput screening process.
